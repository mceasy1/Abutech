ATA has a bank of professional training experience from its affiliate companies such EL-MAXAT SYSTEMS LIMITED with long history of business with government agencies, parastatals as well as the corporate world.<br><br>

Like a spoke in a wheel, our sole role is to pave the path for employable, skilful, creative and innovative individuals, corporate entities and public sector personalities – with a view to establishing a rich and enduring commonwealth based on equity, merit, contentment and human dignity.<br><br>
After all, the illiterates of the future are 
NOT those who cannot read and write but those who CANNOT Learn, Un-Learn and Re-learn! (Alvin Toffler)<br><br>

Finally, ATA adheres to the principles of profitability through sustainable educational transformation and capacity re-engineering; while focusing on restoring sanity, morality and dignity back to our common commonwealth -mankind!<br><br>
 
Finally, we count on your patronage as we pay our esteemed homage in anticipation of your cooperation.
 Together, we could achieve the goal of good education that we all crave and believe in.<br><br>
